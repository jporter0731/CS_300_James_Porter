//This is used as the GitHub repository requirement for CS 300 created in week 7 and added to in week 8

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
This course (CS 300 Analysis and Design) has served to be a very intriguing course to take. In this course we were taught how to compare the runtime and analysis of specific data structures to determine which would be most efficient for a specific problem. In this project we were tasked with creating a simple program that would allow the computer science academic advisors at ABCU to search for specific courses easily and effectively as well as view a list of courses necessary to complete the computer science major.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
To approach this problem, I began by considering three different data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees) and determined which would be most efficient and effective for this problem. This is discussed in detail in the document entitled CS 300 Project 1 James Porter.docx. Ultimately, I determined that the binary search tree would be most efficient and best to use for this problem.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
There were quite a few roadblocks to overcome when working on this project. First and foremost, I didn't have my initial code for the binary search tree implemented properly and led to issues when developing the code as I copied a lot of this code from my initial implementation. Because of the copying, I had added a lot of code without testing the code properly and this led to lots of extra time and steps when I was coding. After I got past my initial struggle, I slowed down and started testing my code in small line sections. This change made a huge impact on how efficiently I was able to complete this project. Another issue I had was in creating the document discussing the different data structures. To get over this challenge, I reread the sections of the book and considered what the book said and figured out how to better explain the data structures.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
My work on this project has shown me the difference between data structures and when each one is most efficient. It has also taught me that there is no one algorithm that works better than the rest in every situation. Each situation calls for a different algorithm depending on the problem.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Like the question above this project has shown me how to develop code using the appropriate data structure. It is also important to write these data structures in a way that they can be reused (which I need to work on).
